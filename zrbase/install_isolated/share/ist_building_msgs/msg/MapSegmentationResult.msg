# result definition
sensor_msgs/Image segmented_map			# the action server returns a map segmented into rooms which carry the segment number in every pixel cell, format 32SC1, room labels from 1 to N, room with label i -> access to room_information_in_pixel[i-1]
float32 map_resolution					# the resolution of the segmented map in [meter/cell]
geometry_msgs/Pose map_origin			# the origin of the segmented map in [meter]
# for the following data: value in pixel can be obtained when the value of [return_format_in_pixel] from goal definition is true
# the computed room centers are not the centroids of the room cells (which could be located outside of the rooms)
# but accessible map pixels located within the center of the largest free space in the room
ist_building_msgs/RoomInformation[] room_information_in_pixel		# room data (min/max coordinates, center coordinates) measured in pixels
# for the following data: value in meter can be obtained when the value of [return_format_in_meter] from goal definition is true
# the computed room centers are not the centroids of the room cells (which could be located outside of the rooms)
# but accessible map pixels located within the center of the largest free space in the room
ist_building_msgs/RoomInformation[] room_information_in_meter		# room data (min/max coordinates, center coordinates) measured in meters
# if wanted the 5th algorithm (vrf) can return single points labeled as a doorway
geometry_msgs/Point32[] doorway_points
